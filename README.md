# Receipt Processor
### Developed by Noah Caulfield (GitHub: [nwc6624](https://github.com/nwc6624))

This is a lightweight receipt processing web service written in Go. It allows users to submit receipts, assigns them a unique identifier, and calculates points based on a predefined set of rules.

## üöÄ Features

- **POST `/receipts/process`**: Accepts a receipt JSON and returns a unique receipt ID.
- **GET `/receipts/{id}/points`**: Retrieves the calculated points for a submitted receipt.

The service stores data **in-memory**, meaning that all receipts will be lost when the application restarts.

## üìå Running the Service

### **Using Docker (Recommended)**
1. **Build the Docker Image:**
   ```sh
   docker build -t receipt-processor .
   ```

2. **Run the Container:**
   ```sh
   docker run -p 8080:8080 --name receipt-processor-container -d receipt-processor
   ```

3. **Check Running Containers (Optional):**
   ```sh
   docker ps
   ```

4. **View Logs (If Needed):**
   ```sh
   docker logs receipt-processor-container
   ```

### **Running Locally (Without Docker)**
#### Prerequisites:
- Go **1.18+**
- Ensure you have Go installed:  
  ```sh
  go version
  ```
#### Steps to Run:
1. Clone the repository:

## üéØ Points Calculation Rules

The points for each receipt are calculated based on the following rules:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **One point for every alphanumeric character in the retailer name.**  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **50 points if the total is a whole dollar amount (e.g., `$35.00`).**  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **25 points if the total is a multiple of `0.25`.**  
4Ô∏è‚É£ **5 points for every two items on the receipt.**  
5Ô∏è‚É£ **If an item description length (after trimming) is a multiple of `3`, multiply the price by `0.2`, round up, and add the result as points.**  
6Ô∏è‚É£ **5 bonus points if the total is greater than `$10.00` (for LLM-generated receipts).**  
7Ô∏è‚É£ **6 points if the purchase date is an **odd** day.**  
8Ô∏è‚É£ **10 points if the purchase time is between `2:00 PM - 4:00 PM`.**
